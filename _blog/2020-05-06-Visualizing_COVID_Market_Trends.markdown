<p> The U.S. unemployment rate is predicted to be 15 to 20% in April </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Confirmed COVID-19 Cases hits new highs every day </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> And yet, stocks recently had it's best week since 1974 </p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>At this point, does more unemployment predict a better stock market? It seems like perhaps doing the complete opposite of intuition will lead to the best portfolio. While there are many factors when considering stock prices, there is no doubt that COVID-19 has been, by far, the largest factor in recent stock market prices. And with stocks rising, it seems that the translation between daily life and stock prices has never been more off.</p>


<p>So what's going on? I propose the key concept lies in that <strong>stock prices are based on future outlooks</strong>. The underlying cause for this mistranslation is that uncertainty and pessimism drop stock prices whereas positive outlook leads to higher current day prices. The question then arises how exactly do we measure something as fantastical as "positive" outlook? Instead of going to typical hard quantitative math with models, I propose measuring the recent stock trends with nothing more than high school math - specifically just <strong>derivatives - otherwise known as the rate of change of recent COVID-19 cases. </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For this article, we will look at stocks in the context of U.S. stocks, the S&P 500. The S&P 500, otherwise simply known as S&P is an index that tracks the stocks of 500 large-cap U.S. companies and is considered to be a good representation of the U.S. stock market. A quick note is that both the S&P and DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) followed similar patterns. Therefore, stocks will be referred to in the context of U.S. stocks (S&P500).</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As mentioned, COVID-19 is the driving force behind a lot of decisions in today's market, so let's examine the number of confirmed cases over time in the US:</p>


![COVID Cases](/assets/img/blog/stock_covid/graph2_cases.jpg)
<center><i style="color:#a6a6a6">Figure 2. Number of Confirmed COVID Cases in the United States</i></center>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well.., looks like all trends point towards human extinction. However, cumulative cases, of course, will always be increasing with time. Therefore, the graph is not a good indicator of the perception of the future value of cases. However, this does lay the critical foundation for stock perception. To get the perception, we introduce a concept not seen by many since high school math: the derivative.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

![Derivative](/assets/img/blog/stock_covid/derivative.png)
<center><i style="color:#a6a6a6">Figure 3. Equation for Derivatives</i></center>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>While potentially intimidating, the derivative is simply capturing the slope, or rate of growth, at that time point / day. This will better capture how fast COVID-19 cases are growing as opposed to looking at the entire graph at once. Therefore, we can take Figure 2 and then calculate the derivative (rate of growth) using the equation in Figure 3. In a car metaphor, velocity would be what the speedometer displays as one drives in a certain direction such as due West - not to be confused with speed which is only the pure mph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

![Velocity](/assets/img/blog/stock_covid/graph3_velocity.jpg)
<center><i style="color:#a6a6a6">Figure 4. Derivative or Rate of Growth of COVID-19 Cases</i></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The COVID-19 situation in Figure 4 now doesn't look as apocalyptic as in Figure 2. Looking at this graph, we can see the most rapid growth occurred in mid-March but is now hovering and "stabilizing" velocity in April. Therefore, although cases are increasing at almost 30,000 new cases a day, the perceived value is that we are now plateauing across the nation 30,000 steady. And that's most likely what investors and bulls are viewing the current market. If now is plateauing instead of nonstop, uncertain growth, then the market has the potential to recover.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But why stop at the first derivative when we can go onto the second derivative - into the world of acceleration:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

![Higher order](/assets/img/blog/stock_covid/higher_order.png)
<center><i style="color:#a6a6a6">Figure 5. Derivative Levels</i></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By applying the formula seen once again in Figure 3, to the graph of Figure 4, we now get the graph of acceleration. Acceleration is measuring the change in velocity - in other words, if we take the car example from earlier - velocity is how fast the car is going in a direction but acceleration measuring when we stomp on the gas pedal to get from 0 to 60 in 3.5 - the same concept as when you floor the gas pedal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

![Acceleration](/assets/img/blog/stock_covid/graph4_accel.jpg)
<center><i style="color:#a6a6a6">Figure 6. Acceleration of U.S. COVID-19 Casess</i></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To see acceleration better, the acceleration is coded red when acceleration is positive (meaning a shift in rapid growth of confirmed cases) and coded green when acceleration is negative (meaning the rate is slowing down). Specifically, in mid-March, we saw more new cases appearing every day, but by the time we reached mid-April, the number of new cases was declining compared to the previous day. And now recently, we fluctuate between the two modes of acceleration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And to step back, combining everything, we get this graph showing total cases, the velocity, and the acceleration, showing the pure number of cases, the velocity, and acceleration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

![Combined](/assets/img/blog/stock_covid/graph5_combined.jpg)
<center><i style="color:#a6a6a6">Figure 7. Confirmed Cases, Velocity, and Acceleration of U.S. COVID-19 Cases</i></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now how does this all relate back to stocks? Simply put, is the glass half empty or half full? Similarly, yes, COVID-19 cases are increasing, but they are increasing slower (/s .. kind of)!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

![Stock Velocity](/assets/img/blog/stock_covid/graph6_stock_velocity.jpg)
<center><i style="color:#a6a6a6">Figure 8 U.S. Stock versus Rate of Domestic COVID-19 Growth</i></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The velocity of the graph seems to also be correlated well with the S&P prices. Stocks presumably dipped prior due to responses to the only past performance predictor of the COVID-19 situation (ie: looking at China's COVID-19 situation) before dipping itself during the peak of COVID-19 growth before finally plateauing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

![Acceleration](/assets/img/blog/stock_covid/graph7_stock_acceleration.jpg)
<center><i style="color:#a6a6a6">Figure 9 U.S. Stock Price versus Acceleration of Domestic COVID-19 Cases</i></center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similarly, we can see the single points of velocity slowing down (green) near when the stock prices start to go up. Through these graphs, we can see that growth in stocks lately is somewhat tied to the perception of COVID-19. Yes, there are more and more cases, but on the other hand, due to quarantines, social distancing, and never before seen methods, the outlook remains positive that we will be able to one day return to a productive and non-apocalyptic state.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That being said, as mentioned early on, stocks aren't affected by just hard math nor hard perception. Some limitations and other things to consider are:</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Global data</strong> - we currently looked at S&P 500 stocks, but as we know, we live in an increasingly global economy. Factors such as the oil price wars, the number of globally confirmed cases, and the death count have undoubtedly played a role in the market's reaction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And a bunch of acronyms:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Safety</strong> (CARES Act) - where Americans can get up to $1,200 may be perceived to be slowing down the effects of businesses closing, furloughing workers, and general employment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Fear of Missing Out</strong> (FOMO) - another psychological concept whereby many people want to capture the "bottom" of the market and end up putting their money back in just because it appears everyone else is. This ultimately could drive the market back up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And many other factors. Have any other ideas, concerns, or disbeliefs of assumptions presented? Please leave a comment below.</p>

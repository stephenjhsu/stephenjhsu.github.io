<p>
We believe the next technological innovation wave is in smart devices, including Amazon Alexa and Google Home. 
</p>

<p>
We understand the current-day obstacles in monetizing smart apps such as subscriptions, one-time purchases, and retention, so we've dug deep into the documentation to make sure your apps will have abilities to sign up for emails and newsletters as well as accept recurring or one-time payments. We believe this method will allow you not only to future-proof yourself, but also see current day benefits.
</p>


<p><strong> What we do: </strong></p>


<p>Develop Alexa and Home Apps such as but not limited to:</p>
- Sound Apps: Create ambient sleep sounds or dedicated podcast apps
- Frequently Asked Questions: like a website landing page, create your own smart home landing apge
- Email Sign Up: Integrate email sign ups into your app
- AAnd any other ideas you have!

<p>
We believe the next technological innovation wave is in smart devices, including Amazon Alexa and Google Home. And although we believe it is the next wave, we understand current-day obstacles in the form of ease of monetizing smart apps and user retention. So we've dug deep into the documentation to make sure your apps allow for user sign ups, intuitive navigation, and smooth transactional payments. We believe this method will allow you not only to future-proof yourself, but also see current day benefits.

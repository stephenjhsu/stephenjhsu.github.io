<p>2020 has changed the way we eat and the way we communicate. Restaurants and even bottles bought at stores all have QR codes to display nutrition facts, scan to pay, and to display menus. Take the contactless power of QRs one step further to develop branded QR codes. At InspireAI, we can help you develop branded QR codes and get tracking analytics such as number of scans, timing of scans, and more - delivered to you in weekly or daily reports. </p>

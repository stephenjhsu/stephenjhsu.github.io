<p><strong>Web Development</strong></p>


<p> Websites are the first step for many companies. A good website not only exists as is, but exists with purpose to attract users, create easy and effective call-to-actions, and give insight into what works and does not work. With our experience in creating, managing, and analyzing website data, we can help you go from just owning a website just to own one to owning a website that benefits you or your company. </p>


<p><strong> What we do </strong></p>

<p> We work on the full development cycle of each and every website. We start with understanding who the customer will be, how to attract and retain them, and set out to complete all non-technical (domain registration, https security) and technical aspects (creation, deployment, and tracking) to make sure your business website runs smoothly and with purpose. </p>

<p><strong> Technologies used but limited to </strong></p>

<p> HTML </p>

<p> Javascript  </p>

<p> CSS </p>

<p> Jekyll </p>

<p> Domain Registration and Renewal </p>

<p> HTTPs Security </p>

<p> Python (Django, Flask) </p>

<p> Back-end database for secure user login (DynamoDB, MongoDB, PostgreSQL) </p>
